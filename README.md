# Fun with Math #

## Overview ##
  > This application is designed to be a visualization tool for budding students of math and science. Mathematics is the language of scientists, and computer science is no exception. Patterns often reveal themselves when viewed within certain scopes that are not immediately obvious. 
  > You'll find this data visualization tool to reveal such patterns in ways you may not expect. If you feel a like a dreamer after your interactions with this tool, you're on the correct path. Keep exploring.

## Problem ##
  > Mathematics can be a difficult concept to grasp. Abstract equations, vector and scalar field representations, and statistical analysis (to name a few) are all necessary tools for the most cutting-edge fields of computer science. The really fun problems in computer science must be solved using these tools.

## Solution ##
  > This tool aims to assist the user in visualizing mathematical equations in ways that are fun and interactive, yet revealing and insightful in unique ways. This should serve as a tool which cultivates curiosity while offering useful and memorable connections between abstract equations and 2-d data representations.

  > "It is our privilege as engineers and scientists to embrace uncertainty and move forth with a sense of wanderlust for the foundations of our reality." - RLS

## Customer Quote ##
  > "This tool completely blew me away. There are patterns in mathematics that resemble the physical world that took me completely by surprise." - John Elway

## How to Get Started ##
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
